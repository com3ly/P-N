    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><u>Why does it cost alot to get my hair & nails done?</u></h1>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">Hair prices keep going up year by year, which tends to make it hard for everyone to look good.
        Due to the cost of living going up day by day salons are forced to also increse their prices because of how expensive it is to maintain the equipment used and the stores.<br>
        Same with doing nails its not expensive because of the colours being used or textures only but because you paying for their talent and quality that the artists can produce.
